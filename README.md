# D2P-Portal: Doctor-to-Patient Portal

Welcome to D2P-Portal, a revolutionary platform designed to facilitate convenient initial treatment for patients by connecting them with experienced doctors. This portal integrates cutting-edge technology, including a Naive-Based classifier using machine learning, to provide AI-suggestions based on patient symptoms. Doctors can then engage with patients by offering personalized treatment recommendations through a post-commenting system.

## Features

#### 1. AI-Suggestions with Naive-Based Classifier

Patients can input their symptoms into the portal, and our Naive-Based classifier will generate AI-suggestions based on the provided information. This assists patients in gaining preliminary insights into potential conditions or ailments.

#### 2. Secure and Private Patient Posts

Patient posts are treated with the utmost privacy. Each patient's post is visible only to the individual patient and the registered doctors on the platform. This ensures a confidential and secure environment for patients to discuss their symptoms.

#### 3. Doctor-Patient Interaction

Doctors can view patient posts and provide treatment suggestions through comments. Patients have the option to accept a doctor's recommendation, and the doctor with the accepted answer earns reputation points. This reputation system encourages doctors to provide high-quality and helpful responses.

#### 4. Doctor Verification

To maintain the credibility of our platform, all doctors must undergo a verification process by submitting proper documents. This ensures that only qualified and verified medical professionals participate in the portal.
